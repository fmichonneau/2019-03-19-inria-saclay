We are pleased to invite you to our Software Carpentry event: a two-day free
workshop that will take place on March 19-20, 2018 (Tuesday - Wednesday) at
Inria Saclay (Turing building) in Palaiseau, France (Paris metropolitan area).

Software Carpentry is a programming course meant to improve the computing skills
of any scientist:
 - automating tasks with the shell,
 - programming in Python,
 - data analysis and visualisation,
 - keeping track of project changes with git

The course is aimed at graduate students and other
researchers. You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that
will be presented at the workshop. Some prior programming experience (in any
language), although not required, will be useful.

The teaching language of the course is English (but there will be
helpers around assisting in French).

Since the course is free and due to limited space, registration is mandatory.
The registration will open on Wednesday February 27 at 10am and the
seats will be distributed on first-come-first-serve basis.

About Software Carpentry

Scientists spend more and more time on programming. While techniques for
writing software are constantly evolving, only few scientists have been trained
to use them. As a result, instead of doing their research, they spend far too
much time writing deficient code and reinventing the wheel. This course is a
two-day hands-on tutorial tailored to the needs of novice Python programmers or
seasoned users of other programming languages. It introduces them to modern
standards of scientific software development. http://software-carpentry.org
